# Unravelling the novel determinants of specificity in CRISPR/Cas9 protein
Gayatri Panda and Arjun Rayâˆ—

This repository contains scripts and input files used for different analysis. 

This Github repository contains four directories
1.	spcas9-scripts 2. fncas9-scripts 3. stcas9-scripts 4. common-scripts. 
Files present in these folders are described pictorially.
Diagram represents the structure of data storage in a GitHub repository, detailing the organization of folders and files.

## All the simulation input (prmtop, inpcrd) can be accessed from the drive link: 
All the simulation related files including the (a) Starting structure PDB), (b) Topology file (prmtop), and (c) Coordinate files (inpcrd) for all twelve protein-complex systems (four for each Cas9 orthologs) are added in a google drive folder. 
Link of this folder is also mentioned in the Github readme and is also added here. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QWCM3Ip4flx-d-e0MNzYq2qlxUyo7um5
 
The google drive consists of three folders in the name of spcas9, fncas9, and stcas9, and compressed trajectories of spcas9 and fncas9. Each folder consist of five subfolders, four for every on-target and off-target system and one mmgbsa folder which contains all input files used in MM-GBSA. Each subfolder for on-target and off-target system contains a starting structure, prmtop and inpcrd file.

Due to different input requirements for different analysis, not all files have been uploaded to this repository. Any additional files can be provided upon request.
