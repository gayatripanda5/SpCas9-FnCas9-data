This repository contains sample trajectory (.netcdf format) and topology (.prmtop format) files provided to peform preliminary analysis as well as the
necessary simulation and analysis scripts. The repository consists of the following directories
1. simulation_data : Starting structure, prmtop, incprd and netcdf file (w/o water and ions)
   
# All the simulation input (prmtop, inpcrd) and trajectory files can be accessed from the drive link : 
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QWCM3Ip4flx-d-e0MNzYq2qlxUyo7um5
Due to different input requirements for different analysis, not all files have been uploaded to this repository. Any additional files can be provided upon request.

2. analysis_scripts : Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for analysing simulation data.
