# Unravelling the novel determinants of specificity in CRISPR/Cas9 protein
Gayatri Panda and Arjun Rayâˆ—

This repository contains sample coordinate and topology files used to perform preliminary analysis as well as the
necessary simulation and analysis scripts. The repository consists of the following directories
1. simulation_data : Starting structure, prmtop, incprd and netcdf file (w/o water and ions)
   
2. analysis_scripts : Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for analysing simulation data.
   This repository consists of separate repositories conntaining inputs used for performing different analysis. 
   
## All the simulation input (prmtop, inpcrd) can be accessed from the drive link : 
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QWCM3Ip4flx-d-e0MNzYq2qlxUyo7um5

Due to different input requirements for different analysis, not all files have been uploaded to this repository. Any additional files can be provided upon request.
