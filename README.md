# Integrating accelerated molecular simulations and AI to elucidate Cas9 specificity factors
Gayatri Panda and Arjun Rayâˆ—

This repository contains scripts and input files used for different analysis. 
This Github repository contains four directories
1.	spcas9-scripts 2. fncas9-scripts 3. stcas9-scripts 4. common-scripts. 
Files present in these folders are described pictorially.

## All the simulation input (prmtop, inpcrd) can be accessed from the drive link: 
Simulation-related files for twelve protein-complex systems (four for each Cas9 orthologs) are available in a Google Drive folder. 
The folder link is mentioned in the GitHub readme and provided here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QWCM3Ip4flx-d-e0MNzYq2qlxUyo7um5
The folder contains three subfolders named after the Cas9 orthologs: spcas9, fncas9, and stcas9. Additionally, there are compressed trajectory files for spcas9 and fncas9.
Each ortholog folder has five subfolders:
1. Four subfolders for on-target and off-target systems containing starting structure, topology,, and coordinate file.
2. One mmgbsa subfolder containing input files used in MM-GBSA

Due to different input requirements for different analysis, not all files have been uploaded to this repository. Any additional files can be provided upon request.
